# Game Lore

## 1. High-Level Premise

Humanity lives in the **Wormhole Era (W.E.)**, centuries after the first stable wormhole appeared near Jupiter (Year 0 W.E.). Using advanced fusion, gravity manipulation, and modular space habitats, humans had built a thriving interplanetary civilisation—until a catastrophic event known as **The Shrouding** ruined Earth and shattered Earth-based power structures.

In the aftermath, a military regime called the **Helios Protectorate** dominates the Solar System. A hopeful exploratory organisation, **The Horizon Initiative**, escapes through a wormhole and becomes the spearhead of a new human diaspora beyond the Sun.

Core themes:

* **Reconstruction** – rebuilding civilisation from scattered remnants
* **Survival** – managing resources, populations, and threats
* **Exploration** – charting and understanding a permanent wormhole network
* **Long-term hope** – including the dream of one day restoring Earth

## 2. Cosmology & Wormhole Origin

Long before humans reached space, an **ancient civilisation** mastered black-hole engineering and the creation of artificial wormholes. They are gone, leaving only relics and partially understood technologies.

Much later, another alien civilisation discovered traces of this technology and attempted to harness it for rapid advancement. Their **careless, incomplete understanding** led to a catastrophic experiment:

* The experiment seeded a **vast network of wormholes** across many star systems.
* Many of these wormholes stabilised, forming a **permanent network**.
* This event affected numerous systems—including Earth’s Solar System.

### Wormhole Network Properties

* **Stable and permanent**: once formed, a wormhole does not drift or disappear.
* **Fixed topology**: star systems become **nodes** in a static graph linked by wormholes.
* **Limited control**: current civilisations (human and alien) use the network but do not fully understand or govern it.

**Inter-system travel** is only possible by passing through these wormholes.

## 3. The Shrouding

### Name & Era

* The catastrophe that ruined Earth is known as **The Shrouding**.
* The primary calendar is the **Wormhole Era (W.E.)**, where:

  * **Year 0 W.E.** = appearance of the first stable wormhole near Jupiter.

### Trigger: Jupiter Wormhole

In the early Wormhole Era, a large wormhole formed near **Jupiter**. The gas giant’s vast magnetosphere interacted with the wormhole’s exotic fields, producing enormous **electromagnetic disturbances** across the Solar System.

### Fusion-Grid Collapse

Humanity had transitioned to a dense network of **fusion reactors**:

* Ground-based stations
* Orbital and underwater reactors
* Distributed power grids integrated with high-level automation and AI

The EM disturbance caused:

* Widespread disruption of control systems and failsafes
* Many reactors entering **runaway failure** nearly simultaneously

The result was a **fusion-grid collapse**:

* Multiple containment breaches
* Planetary-scale explosions and fires
* Cascading infrastructure failures

### Earth’s Transformation

The fusion catastrophe on and around Earth triggered:

* Global firestorms and industrial megafires
* Massive injection of soot, aerosols, radioactive fallout, and toxins into the atmosphere
* A prolonged **fusion/nuclear winter** followed by severe climate rebound

Earth became:

* A **toxic graveyard world** with:

  * Violent storms and unstable climate
  * Ruined biosphere and destroyed megacities
  * Vast reactor craters and irradiated regions

Importantly:

* Earth is **structurally intact** (no planet-breaking impact).
* In the very long term, **terraforming and restoration are theoretically possible**, given immense resources and technology.

Billions died. **The Shrouding** is the foundational trauma of human history in the Wormhole Era.

## 4. State of the Solar System

### 4.1 Surviving Infrastructure

After The Shrouding, the Solar System is scarred but not empty:

* **Earth**

  * Accessible but economically useless at game start.
  * Toxic atmosphere, dead soils, storm belts.
  * A cautionary monument and potential late-game restoration project.

* **Mars**

  * Largest surviving population centre.
  * Important shipyards, domed cities, and industrial complexes.
  * Key political and economic hub.

* **Cislunar & Inner-System Space**

  * Orbital habitats, research stations, industrial platforms.
  * Many are damaged, under-crew, or under Helios control.

* **Outer-System Facilities**

  * Scientific outposts, listening posts, and deep-space infrastructure.
  * Some abandoned, some militarised.

### 4.2 Cultural Attitudes Toward Earth

* **General Solar civilians**:

  * See Earth as a **cautionary monument**—a permanent reminder of hubris and overreach.

* **The Horizon Initiative**:

  * Sees Earth as a **future project / promise**.
  * Restoring Earth is a distant but meaningful goal: proof that humanity can own and repair its mistakes.

---

### 5.3 Other Human Factions

These factions exist within the broader lore and can appear as allies, rivals, or background powers.

1. **Industrial Syndicate**

   * Coalition of major shipyards, mining corporations, and heavy-industry worker blocs.
   * Controls much of the refining, fabrication, and shipbuilding capacity.
   * Pragmatic, focused on profit and stability over ideology.

2. **Frontier League**

   * Loose network of frontier colonies, prospectors, and nomad fleets.

   * Suspicious of both Helios and any large central authority—including Horizon if it grows too powerful.

3. **Faithful Remnants**

   * Religious/cultural movement centring Earth and The Shrouding in its beliefs.
   * Internal split:

     * Isolationists: minimise wormhole travel, focus on spiritual survival.
     * Reformers: see careful expansion and eventual Earth restoration as a sacred duty.

4. **Verdant Compact**

   * Ecological reconstructionists and terraforming advocates.
   * Focus on sustainable colonies, closed-loop ecologies, and planetary restoration.
   * Strong narrative alignment with the dream of one day healing Earth.

### 5.4 Non-Human Powers

1. **The Myriad Combine**

   * Multi-species mercantile coalition.
   * Treats wormholes chiefly as trade routes.
   * Sees humanity as a small but potentially useful new participant in their economic web.

2. **The Verdure Hegemony**

   * Bio-engineering civilisation that grows organic ships and habitats.
   * Views planets as gardens to shape and curate.
   * Natural thematic interplay with the Verdant Compact (ally, rival, or both).

3. **The Aelari Concord**

   * Tall, slender humanoids with subtle bioluminescent markings.
   * Highly diplomatic, valuing treaties and long-term pacts.
   * Often approach younger species (like humans) as potential protégés.

4. **The Karthan Assemblies**

   * Heavier-gravity humanoids with reinforced physiques.
   * Society structured into industrial “assemblies” (clans) specialising in various heavy tasks.
   * Respect engineering prowess, reliable contracts, and straightforward dealings.

   * Humanoids with faint chitin plating and faceted eyes, adapted to harsh environments.
   * Prefer stations and asteroid belts, comfortable in radiation and extremes.
   * Value stability and predictable partnerships.

---

### 5.5 Pirates

* Pirates are a **constant cross-species phenomenon**:

  * Human, alien, and mixed crews.
  * Sometimes backed by factions, sometimes fully independent.
* Activities:

  * Raiding trade routes.
  * Preying on weak outposts and frontier colonies.
  * Acting as mercenaries or brokers in grey markets.

---

## 6. AI in the Wormhole Era

AI is **widespread but distrusted**:

* Critical for:

  * Logistics, routing, and station operations
  * Targeting, threat analysis, and combat support
  * Environmental control and life-support optimisation

Public opinion and politics:

* Many blame over-automated, poorly supervised systems for exacerbating The Shrouding.
* The Helios Protectorate:

  * Uses fear of “runaway AI” to justify strict control and surveillance.
* The Horizon Initiative:

  * Treats AI as necessary tools and partners, with an emphasis on transparency and human oversight.

Some fringe groups (e.g. within the Faithful Remnants) see advanced AI as spiritually dangerous or morally suspect.

---

## 7. Travel & Gravity Drives

### 7.1 Intra-System Travel

Ships use a combination of:

* **Gravity Drives**

  * Generate directed gravitational fields enabling ships to “fall” in chosen directions.
  * Provide high acceleration with partial inertial damping.

* **Ion Thrusters**

  * Efficient, continuous low-thrust engines.
  * Used for fine maneuvering, docking, and combat movement.

**Gameplay Model**

* **Travel Mode**

  * Player sets a destination (station, planet, waypoint).
  * Ship enters a high-speed gravity-vector mode:

    * A route is visualised.
    * The ship accelerates quickly along that vector.
    * Maneuverability is reduced to avoid micro-management.

* **Combat / Manual Mode**

  * Gravity drive throttled or pulsed.
  * Ion thrusters and gravity bursts allow agile movement in combat.

Optional advanced features for later development:

* Gravity lanes / highways (engineered fast routes).
* Slingshot maneuvers around large bodies.
* Interdiction fields that drop ships out of travel mode.

### 7.2 Inter-System Travel

* **Wormhole Transit**

  * Ships traverse permanent wormholes once equipped with:

    * **Gravitational shields** to withstand tidal and EM stresses.
    * Sufficient power reserves and stability.

---

## 8. Economy, Population & Construction

### 8.1 Population

Population functions as a **primary strategic resource**:

* Colonies generate population over time based on:

  * Living conditions
  * Safety
  * Supply stability
* Population is required for:

  * Crewing ships
  * Staffing stations and colonies
  * Providing specialists (researchers, administrators, etc.)

Players must balance:

* Militarisation and expansion Vs. local population growth and economic strength.

---

### 8.2 Resources

Resources exist in several tiers:

* **Raw Resources**

  * Ores (metals, rare metals)
  * Volatiles (water, gases, ices)
  * Organics (biomass, food stock)

* **Refined Materials**

  * Structural alloys, composites
  * Electronics, advanced components
  * Habitat and life-support modules

* **Strategic Resources**

  * Exotics related to gravity and wormhole technology
  * Advanced reactor materials and high-end AI cores
  * Rare alien substances with unique properties

**Uses:**

* Construction and upgrade of ships, stations, and colony structures.
* Maintenance, repairs, and life support.
* Advanced research and high-tier weapon systems.

---

### 8.3 Logistics

* All physical resources and population move **only by ships**:

  * No matter teleportation.
  * Wormholes move ships and cargo, not raw resources by themselves.

* Player defines **high-level logistics orders**, for example:

  * “Keep Station A stocked with X, Y, Z.”
  * “Route ore from Mining Outpost 1 → Refinery 3 → Shipyard 2.”

* The simulation handles:

  * Individual transport runs
  * Route selection
  * Exposure to risks (pirates, interdiction, blockades)

---

### 8.4 Construction & Modularity

Ships and stations are built from **modular components**:

* Core modules:

  * Reactors, capacitors, gravity drives, ion thrusters
  * Hull sections, bulkheads, structural frames

* Functional modules:

  * Weapon hardpoints (lasers, ballistic turrets, missile pods)
  * Utility modules (hangars, labs, hydroponics, cargo bays)
  * Habitat blocks, command centres, sensor arrays

**Constraints:**

* Power generation vs. power consumption
* Mass, volume, and structural capacity
* Crew and population limits

Stronger or more advanced modules cost more resources, consume more power, and require more crew.
