# Backlog

## TODO
- Build the `SpaceSandbox` scene with the X4-style controllable player ship using `PlayerShipController`; place the player spawn manually under a `SpawnController` per UNITY_CONFIGURATION.md.
- Import and assign a starfield-only skybox/HDRI to deliver the clean space backdrop (no nebulas or clouds).

## DONE
- Documented initial flight and spawn scripts plus setup steps for the basic space scene.
